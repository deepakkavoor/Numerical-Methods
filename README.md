This is a collection of algorithms discussed in "Numerical Methods" course.

## Contents

Below is the description of Jupyter notebooks present in this repo:

#### 1. [Root finding](root-finding.ipynb)

Finding solutions for equations of the form `f(x) = 0`.

#### 2. [System of equations](system-of-equations.ipynb)

- System of linear equations: Finding solutions of system of linear equations (`AX = B`).
- System of non-linear equations

#### 3. [Interpolation](interpolation.ipynb)


[Python-scripts](Python-scripts) folder contains python scripts for the above
